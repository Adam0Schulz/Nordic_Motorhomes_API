# Nordic_Motorhomes_API

This project is building on / is an expansion of my second semester final project at Uni (KEA - Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. Due to the time constrains my group didn't have enough time to finish what we have planned out and the whole project had to be rushed at the end. Therefore I decided to finish what my group and I started. :)

## Back-end
- Spring boot -> REST API

### API URIs
/api/{authKey}/bookings
/api/{authKey}/motorhomes

/api/{authKey}/bookings/{id}
/api/{authKey}/bookings/{status} (e.g. active, past, upcoming)


## Front-end
- React.js
