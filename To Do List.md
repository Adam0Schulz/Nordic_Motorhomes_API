# To Do List

- rethink **status system in database** - instead of having tables for the states having table for all the states and just connecting it to the bookings
- rethink **service layer** - if something wouldn't be **easier** to do just by **querying**
- redo the **motorhome availability** in service layer to avoid **dependency cycle**
- rethink motorhome status because it maybe doesn't make sense.  On a second thought it maybe does but still how does it work when the repairs take longer or something like that
